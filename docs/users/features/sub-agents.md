# Sub-Agents

Delegate focused tasks to specialized AI agents with their own system prompts, tool restrictions, and model selection.

This page covers how to create and use sub-agents, the configuration format, built-in agents, and multi-agent team coordination.

## Create a sub-agent

Sub-agents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `.proto/agents/` (project) or `~/.proto/agents/` (global). Project agents take precedence over global agents with the same name.

### Minimal example

Create `.proto/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
---

You are a code reviewer. Analyze code for:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Maintainability concerns

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file paths and line numbers.
```

### Use the agent

Ask the model naturally and it will delegate based on the `description` field:

```
Review the authentication module for security issues
```

Or invoke explicitly:

```
Use the code-reviewer agent to check my recent changes
```

### Management commands

| Command          | Purpose                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/agents create` | Guided agent creation wizard       |
| `/agents manage` | View, edit, delete existing agents |

## Configuration reference

### Frontmatter fields

| Field                        | Required | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                       | Yes      | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens, 2-50 chars) |
| `description`                | Yes      | When to delegate to this agent                     |
| `tools`                      | No       | Allowlist of permitted tools. Omit to inherit all. |
| `disallowedTools`            | No       | Denylist of tools to exclude from inherited set    |
| `permissionMode`             | No       | `default`, `plan`, `autoEdit`, `yolo`              |
| `modelConfig.model`          | No       | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or full model ID        |
| `modelConfig.temp`           | No       | Temperature (0-2)                                  |
| `runConfig.max_turns`        | No       | Maximum agentic turns                              |
| `runConfig.max_time_minutes` | No       | Maximum execution time                             |
| `color`                      | No       | Display color for UI                               |

### Tool restrictions

Two mechanisms control which tools an agent can use:

**Allowlist (`tools`)** — Only these tools are available:

```yaml
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
  - glob
```

**Denylist (`disallowedTools`)** — Remove these from the inherited set:

```yaml
disallowedTools:
  - write_file
  - edit
```

When both are specified, `disallowedTools` is applied first, then `tools` filters the remainder.

### Permission mode

Override the session's permission mode for a specific agent:

| Mode       | Behavior                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `default`  | Standard confirmation prompts    |
| `plan`     | Read-only, no file modifications |
| `autoEdit` | Auto-approve file edits          |
| `yolo`     | Auto-approve everything          |

If the parent session uses bypass permissions, it takes precedence.

### Template variables

System prompts support `${variable}` syntax. Variables are resolved from `ContextState` at runtime.

### Storage hierarchy

| Level     | Location                        | Priority |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Session   | Passed via SDK at runtime       | Highest  |
| Project   | `.proto/agents/`                | 2        |
| User      | `~/.proto/agents/`              | 3        |
| Extension | Installed extension's `agents/` | 4        |
| Built-in  | Embedded in proto               | Lowest   |

When multiple agents share the same name, higher-priority location wins.

## Built-in agents

Four agents are always available:

| Agent             | Purpose                                              | Tools               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `general-purpose` | Complex multi-step tasks, code search                | All (except Agent)  |
| `Explore`         | Fast codebase search and analysis                    | Read-only + RepoMap |
| `verify`          | Review changes for correctness before finalizing     | Read-only           |
| `coordinator`     | Orchestrate multi-agent work with task decomposition | All + Agent         |

The `Explore` and `Plan` agents use the `repo_map` tool automatically at the start of tasks on large codebases to orient themselves via import-graph PageRank before diving in. You can also call `repo_map` explicitly from any agent. See [Agent Harness — Repo map](../../developers/harness#repo-map) for details.

## Multi-sample retry

For high-stakes tasks where a single failed attempt is costly, set `multi_sample: true` on the Agent tool call. The harness will automatically retry up to 2 more times with escalating temperatures (0.7 → 1.0 → 1.3) if the first attempt fails, and return the best result.

```json
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Implement the auth service",
  "prompt": "...",
  "multi_sample": true
}
```

Each retry includes a `[RETRY CONTEXT]` block summarizing what went wrong in the previous attempt. Attempts are scored (GOAL + verification pass = 3, GOAL = 3, partial = 1, error = 0) and the highest-scoring result is returned. When scores tie, the earlier (lower-temperature) attempt wins.

Use multi-sample for complex implementation tasks, not for searches or read-only queries.

See [Agent Harness — Multi-sample retry](../../developers/harness#multi-sample-retry) for the full scoring and temperature reference.

## Behavior verification gate

You can configure post-task verification scenarios that run automatically after a subagent completes successfully. If any scenario fails, the output is fed back to the agent so it can self-correct.

Create `.proto/verify-scenarios.json` in your project root:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Unit tests pass",
    "command": "npm test -- --run",
    "timeoutMs": 60000
  },
  {
    "name": "Build succeeds",
    "command": "npm run build",
    "timeoutMs": 30000
  }
]
```

Scenarios run in parallel. Each has a `name`, a shell `command`, an optional `expectedPattern` (regex the stdout must match), and an optional `timeoutMs`. Exit code 0 is a pass when no pattern is specified.

See [Agent Harness — Behavior verification gate](../../developers/harness#behavior-verification-gate) for the complete field reference.

## Background execution

Agents can run in the background using `run_in_background: true` in the Agent tool call:

- Returns immediately with an agent ID
- Runs concurrently while the main conversation continues
- Completion notification is injected at the next tool boundary
- Results appear alongside tool results via mid-turn injection

The `coordinator` agent uses this to delegate subtasks in parallel.

## Agent teams

Teams enable coordinated multi-agent work with shared task visibility and messaging.

### Team commands

| Command                                | Description               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `/team list`                           | List all configured teams |
| `/team start <name> [member:type ...]` | Create and start a team   |
| `/team status <name>`                  | Show team member status   |
| `/team stop <name>`                    | Stop a running team       |
| `/team delete <name>`                  | Delete a team config      |

### Start a team

```
/team start research researcher:Explore implementer:general-purpose
```

Default (no members specified): `lead` (coordinator) + `scout` (Explore).

Team config is stored at `.proto/teams/{name}/config.json`.

### Shared task list

Teammates share task visibility through the task system:

- **Claim a task**: `claimTask(id, agentId)` atomically assigns and starts it
- **Find available work**: `getUnclaimedTasks()` returns pending tasks with no assignee
- Tasks track their `assignee` for ownership

### Inter-agent messaging

`TeamMailbox` enables direct communication:

| Method                     | Purpose                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `send(from, to, message)`  | Direct message to a teammate        |
| `broadcast(from, message)` | Message all teammates except sender |
| `receive(agentId)`         | Drain unread messages               |
| `peek(agentId)`            | Read without draining               |

### Team lifecycle hooks

Three hook events fire during team coordination:

| Hook            | When it fires                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TeammateIdle`  | Background agent finishes (exit 2 = reject, send feedback) |
| `TaskCreated`   | Task added to shared list                                  |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task marked done                                           |

See [Hooks](./hooks.md#team-events) for configuration details.

## Design guidelines

### Single responsibility

Each agent should have one clear purpose.

```yaml
# Focused
name: testing-expert
description: Writes comprehensive unit and integration tests

# Too broad
name: general-helper
description: Helps with testing, documentation, review, and deployment
```

### Actionable descriptions

Write descriptions that clearly indicate when to delegate:

```yaml
# Clear trigger
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability

# Vague
description: A helpful code reviewer
```

### Minimal tool access

Grant only the tools the agent needs. Read-only agents should not have `write_file` or `edit`.

### Proactive delegation

Include "use proactively" in the description to encourage automatic delegation without explicit user request.

## SDK subagent configuration

When using the [TypeScript SDK](../reference/sdk-api.md), pass subagent configurations directly via the `agents` option. The primary agent decides when to invoke each subagent based on its `description`.

```typescript
import { query, type SubagentConfig } from '@qwen-code/sdk';

const reviewer: SubagentConfig = {
  name: 'code-reviewer',
  description:
    'Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems',
  systemPrompt: `You are a code reviewer. Review diffs for:
- Logic errors and edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance regressions
Output a structured review with severity levels.`,
  level: 'session',
  tools: ['Read', 'Glob', 'Grep', 'Bash'],
  modelConfig: { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6' },
};

const conversation = query({
  prompt: 'Review the changes in the current branch',
  options: { agents: [reviewer] },
});
```

### SubagentConfig fields

| Field                        | Required | Type        | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                       | Yes      | `string`    | Unique identifier                                  |
| `description`                | Yes      | `string`    | When to delegate to this agent                     |
| `systemPrompt`               | Yes      | `string`    | System prompt for the subagent                     |
| `level`                      | Yes      | `'session'` | Subagent scope (currently only `'session'`)        |
| `tools`                      | No       | `string[]`  | Allowlist of permitted tools. Omit to inherit all. |
| `modelConfig.model`          | No       | `string`    | Model ID or alias (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`)      |
| `modelConfig.temp`           | No       | `number`    | Temperature (0-2)                                  |
| `runConfig.max_turns`        | No       | `number`    | Maximum agentic turns                              |
| `runConfig.max_time_minutes` | No       | `number`    | Maximum execution time in minutes                  |
| `color`                      | No       | `string`    | Display color                                      |

### Multiple subagents with different models

```typescript
const architect: SubagentConfig = {
  name: 'architect',
  description: 'Designs system architecture and makes high-level decisions',
  systemPrompt: 'You are a senior architect...',
  level: 'session',
  modelConfig: { model: 'claude-opus-4-6' },
};

const implementer: SubagentConfig = {
  name: 'implementer',
  description: 'Implements code changes based on specifications',
  systemPrompt: 'You implement code changes...',
  level: 'session',
  tools: ['Read', 'Write', 'Edit', 'Glob', 'Grep', 'Bash'],
  modelConfig: { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6' },
};

const conversation = query({
  prompt: 'Design and implement the caching layer',
  options: { agents: [architect, implementer] },
});
```

SDK-configured subagents have the highest priority in the [storage hierarchy](#storage-hierarchy) (session level). They override project or user agents with the same name.

See the [SDK subagent examples](../../developers/examples/sdk-agents.md) for more patterns.
